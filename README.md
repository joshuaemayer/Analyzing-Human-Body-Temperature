# What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?
# Background
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37∘C or 98.6∘F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

# Conclusion

In summary, I concluded that the sample elected was large enough to assume that temperature is normally distributed and that the CLT applies. One open question is related to the indepedence of the samples, given the equal number of male and female participants.

Using both one-sample and two-sample tests, I proved that the population mean is likely not 98.6 degrees, however, the one-sample p-value was more definitive.
In researching a reasonable range for body temperature, and using a 95% confidence interval, it may be said that temperatures below 96.7 degrees or above 99.7 degrees are cause for concern.

In addition, the two-sample test of men vs women temperature showed that there is likely a difference in body temperatures between men and women.
